# 2. Set Operations in Data Analysis
# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance your skills in using Python sets for data analysis tasks. You will apply various set operations to handle real-world data scenarios, focusing on their practical application and efficiency.

# Task 1: Duplicate Entries Cleanup You are given a list of customer IDs, some of which are duplicated. Write a Python script to remove duplicates and display the unique customer IDs.

# Example Code:

customer_ids = ["C001", "C002", "C003", "C002", "C001", "C004"]
# Expected Outcome: A set of unique customer IDs, ensuring no duplicates. For instance, `{'C001', 'C002', 'C003', 'C004'}`. ---


no_dups = set(customer_ids)
print (no_dups)
